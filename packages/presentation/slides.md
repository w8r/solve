# What is the problem?

<br/>

  Everyone has problems: health, money, relationships or the meaning of life itself. Some of them are very hard. And they never stop repeating themselves. Problem is - we are often not very good at identifying and resolving them and it gets infinitely harder when we are ill, depressed or under a lot of stress.

# What is a problem?

<br/>

In order to understand the root cause of our issues and/or ask for help when needed, we should be able to state our problem and communicate it very clearly.

For some cases, words alone can be enough to express ourselves.

However, problems are not always simple enough to put clearly or to be solved without assistance.

# What is the problem?

<br>
<div class="w-md">

- Problems can be expressed visually as graphs: entities and relationships between them.
- Human brain is amazing at finding and matching patterns.
- Two hands are better than one: collaboration allows discovering different points of view to the same problem.

# Where does the idea come from?

<div class="w-md">

  - you often cannot put your problems into words
  - you keep on forgetting what you have already formulated
  - you are not very good at seeing patterns in your problems
  - but you can see them well in the problems of others
  - you are often an "unreliable partner" to yourself

<div class="w-md">

# You can see this pattern everywhere:

 - mental health issues
 - money management
 - relationships problems
 - long-lasting projects
 - self-discovery

# How to solve problems?

### We have designed an application that will help you to:

<div class="p-12">

 - identify and describe your problems with visualisations
 - apply hierarchical thinking to solve your problems
 - share your problems with others and work together to solve them
 - help others by proposing your solutions
 - share your ideas

# Reward and gamification

<br/>

Every step taken in the app takes you closer to solving your problem. There are score points awarded for each action, and the type of action is taken into account. The app will then assess the experience you have acquired in different actions and fields and you can become an expert of it and your suggestions will be perceived as more valuable.

If you don't want to be in that game, the score points are there just to keep you motivated and to keep track of your own activity.

The point of it is that you never stop improving.

# Versioning
No data is lost.

All changes made to the visualisations are stored as a copy of the data, connected to the previous version. With this simple solution we can travers full history of the visualisation and see how it was changed. We can also isolate areas and accept changes at different stages of the process.

```mermaid {scale: 0.9}
flowchart RL
    Current --> Prev --> Head
```

```mermaid
graph RL;
    latest --> A;
    latest --> B;
    A(Version A) -->first;
    B(Version B) -->A;
```

# Future plans

### Machine Learning:

The app stores structured data for problems and edits, as well as which solutions were accepted to which problems. This can be used as dataset for supervised NN training. With AI, it could be possible to find patterns and propose solutions data or toolkits for types of problems.

---
layout: image-right
image: /screens/general2.png

# Future plans

### Template marketplace

We don't demonstrate this functionality because it will need a lot of research and design to finish it. It's about the tools to work with the visualisation itself depending on the context. Depending on the type of the problems, different tools will be available for resolving and untangling them.

You would have a walkthrough tool that, as soon as you describe a problem node, would suggest you the steps to split, reformulate and resolve it.

We want the users to be able to create these templates.
